# cakephp_userskills

set up a new CakePHP application that provides two REST API points and a simple admin panel.

These API points should be
/users-list
/user-details.

Users-list should return a JSON list with users from DB.

Keys should be
- user_id,
- user_name,
- age,
- phone_number.

User-details API should take user_id and return a JSON list of user details,

keys should be
- user_name,
- phone_number,
- skills.

In the admin panel, I should have the ability to add new users, add/edit skills for every user (multiply list).

Skills should be stored in a separate table.
